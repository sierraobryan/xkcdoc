TODO: 
- Image processing (ie, fill space within constrainsts - Picasso should in theory be able to do this but it isn't working) 
- DONE USING THIRD PART LIBRARY: Magnification (Maybe use that magnifier 2 or somethign that they noted during io?)
- Dynamic scaling still a problem 
- Add Random refresh button to single image view
